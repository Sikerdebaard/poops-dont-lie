## Introduction
Poops don't lie is a python package and standardisation initiative for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater data processing, analysis and presentation. Its aim is to bundle global wastewater datasets in such a way that the processes are as similar as possible, making the data more interoperable and comparable between countries and regions.
